\section{Sample Mean and Sample Variance}
Let \(Z\)'s be i.i.d. r.v.'s \(\backslash\)w common mean \(\mu\) and variance
\(\sigma^2\). Define the \emph{sample mean} and \emph{sample variance} by\\
\(\bar{Z} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i\)\\
\(S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (Z_i = Z)^2\)\\
Then the expectation of these \dots things are what you would \textbf{expect}.
